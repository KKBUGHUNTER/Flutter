FirebaseCommandException: An error occured on the Firebase CLI when attempting to run a command.
COMMAND: firebase --version
ERROR: The FlutterFire CLI currently requires the official Firebase CLI to also be installed, see https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#install_the_firebase_cli for how to install it.

## [Error] And i tried this method also

I apologize for the inconvenience. It seems that even after installing the Firebase CLI, you are still encountering the same error.

In this case, you can try an alternative approach to configure Firebase for your Flutter project:

Step 1: Remove existing Firebase configuration
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your Flutter project.
3. Run the following command to remove the existing Firebase configuration:
   ```
   flutterfire configure --remove
   ```

Step 2: Manually configure Firebase in your Flutter project
1. Open your Flutter project in an editor.
2. Navigate to the `android/app` directory.
3. Open the `build.gradle` file.
4. Add the following lines at the end of the file:
   ```
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   ```
5. Save the file and close it. by ChatGPT

Step 3: Reconfigure Firebase using the FlutterFire CLI
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your Flutter project.
3. Run the following command to configure Firebase using the FlutterFire CLI:
   ```
   flutterfire configure --project=testing-8aa0c
   ```
   Replace `testing-8aa0c` with the actual project ID of your Firebase project.

This approach bypasses the automatic Firebase CLI detection and directly configures Firebase for your Flutter project. It should help you proceed without encountering the previous error.

## [Error] And again I get this error

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the `flutterfire configure --remove` command is not recognized. You can manually remove the Firebase configuration by following these steps:

1. Open your Flutter project in an editor.
2. Navigate to the `android/app` directory.
3. Delete the `google-services.json` file.
4. Open the `build.gradle` file in the same directory.
5. Remove the following lines:
   ```
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   ```
6. Save the file and close it.

By removing the `google-services.json` file and the associated plugin in the `build.gradle` file, you are effectively removing the Firebase configuration from your Flutter project.

After removing the configuration, you can proceed to reconfigure Firebase by following the steps mentioned earlier:

1. Install the Firebase CLI by running the command `npm install -g firebase-tools`.
2. Log in to Firebase by running `firebase login`.
3. Navigate to your Flutter project's root directory in the terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the command `flutterfire configure --project=testing-8aa0c` to configure Firebase for your project.
   Replace `testing-8aa0c` with the actual project ID of your Firebase project.

Please note that you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your system to use the Firebase CLI. If you haven't installed them, make sure to do so before following the steps above.

If you encounter any further issues, please let me know.
